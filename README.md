If you don't see the creators of maps you use it's because the presets are based on maps that I have on my server and from creators who have made themselves available for the creation of presets and on which I can therefore make presets.
- **If you're a creator** and you want presets for your maps contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WKtk65yBC6)
- **If you're a server owner** and you want presets for maps of a creator ask the creator to contact me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/WKtk65yBC6) to organize us
